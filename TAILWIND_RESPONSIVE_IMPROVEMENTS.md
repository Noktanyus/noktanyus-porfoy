**Added capability-based breakpoints:**
- `touch`: For touch devices
- `no-touch`: For non-touch devices
- `can-hover`: For devices that support hover
- `landscape/portrait`: Orientation-based
- `retina`: High DPI screens
- `reduce-motion`: Accessibility preference

#### 2. Enhanced Spacing Scale for Mobile Experience

**Added mobile-optimized spacing:**
- Fine-grained spacing values (0.5, 1.5, 2.5, etc.)
- Touch target sizes (`touch-sm`: 44px, `touch-md`: 48px, `touch-lg`: 56px)
- Mobile-specific spacing (`mobile-xs` to `mobile-2xl`)
- Extended spacing scale up to 256rem for large layouts

**Container and sizing improvements:**
- Enhanced max-width scale (up to 11xl)
- Content-specific max widths (`prose-sm` to `prose-xl`)
- Mobile-specific max widths
- Touch target minimum widths and heights

#### 3. Comprehensive Responsive Typography Utilities

**Device-specific typography scales:**
- Mobile typography (`mobile-xs` to `mobile-xl`)
- Heading scales for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Body text scales for different screen sizes
- Caption text with responsive sizing

**Responsive typography components:**
- `.text-responsive-display`: Scales from 3xl to 6xl
- `.text-responsive-heading`: Scales from xl to 3xl
- `.text-responsive-body`: Scales from sm to lg
- `.text-heading-responsive-sm/md/lg/xl`: Contextual heading sizes
- `.text-body-responsive-sm/md/lg`: Contextual body sizes
- `.text-caption-responsive`: Responsive caption text

#### 4. Advanced Aspect Ratio Configuration

**Enhanced aspect ratio system:**
- Social media ratios (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn)
- Device-specific ratios (mobile portrait/landscape, tablet, desktop)
- Content-specific ratios (blog cards, project cards, gallery thumbs)
- Responsive aspect ratios that change based on screen size

**Dynamic responsive aspect ratios:**
- `.aspect-responsive-video`: 4:3 → 16:9
- `.aspect-responsive-photo`: 1:1 → 4:3
- `.aspect-responsive-banner`: 2:1 → 3:1 → 4:1
- `.aspect-project-card`: 1:1 → 4:3 → 16:10
- `.aspect-blog-card`: 4:3 → 16:9
- `.aspect-hero-image`: 4:3 → 3:2 → 5:2

#### 5. Mobile-First Component System

**Responsive container utilities:**
- `.container-responsive`: Mobile-first container with adaptive padding
- Automatic max-width constraints at each breakpoint
- Progressive padding increases (4 → 6 → 8 → 10 → 12)

**Touch-optimized components:**
- `.btn-touch`: 44px minimum touch targets with responsive sizing
- `.form-input-responsive`: 48px mobile inputs, 44px desktop
- `.card-responsive`: Adaptive padding and shadows
- `.image-container-responsive`: Responsive image containers with hover effects

**Responsive layout utilities:**
- `.grid-responsive-cards`: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 column grid
- `.grid-responsive-auto`: Auto-fit grid with responsive min-widths
- `.flex-responsive-center`: Column → row responsive flex
- `.flex-responsive-between`: Responsive space-between layout

#### 6. Enhanced Mobile Optimizations

**Performance optimizations:**
- `.mobile-optimized`: Hardware acceleration and font smoothing
- Mobile-specific shadows (lighter for performance)
- Reduced animation complexity for mobile
- Touch-specific interaction states

**Touch interaction utilities:**
- `.touch-manipulation`: Optimized touch handling
- `.touch-pan-x/y`: Directional pan gestures
- `.scroll-smooth-mobile`: Optimized mobile scrolling
- Touch feedback animations

**Safe area utilities:**
- `.pt-safe`, `.pb-safe`, `.pl-safe`, `.pr-safe`: Device safe areas
- `.h-dvh`, `.min-h-dvh`: Dynamic viewport height support

#### 7. Responsive Visibility and Behavior

**Device-specific visibility:**
- `.show-mobile`: Visible only on mobile
- `.hide-mobile`: Hidden on mobile
- `.show-tablet`: Visible only on tablet
- `.show-desktop`: Visible only on desktop

**Responsive text handling:**
- `.truncate-responsive-1/2/3`: Progressive line clamping
- Responsive text truncation that adapts to screen size

#### 8. Enhanced Animation and Transition System

**Mobile-optimized animations:**
- Reduced duration and complexity for mobile
- Touch-specific feedback animations
- Respect for `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Performance-optimized keyframes

**Responsive transition timing:**
- Mobile-specific easing functions
- Adaptive animation durations
- Touch interaction feedback
